# express-basic-practice
A very basic node/express server with simple full-stack capablities. For learning purposes.

This app can be used or cloned/forked by anyone if they want to play around with the code. Meant for NodeJS begginers. Instructions at the bottom.

In this app we:
- We set up a basic Express.js server in server.js as the base of our app
- Routing: We handle different routes from their own file. Including GET, and POST requests coming in from the client side.
- We create basic middleware functions including a simple error handler
- We serve static files from our /public/ folder using express.static
- I simulate simple data from a database in /data/users.js.
- We use a templating engine called EJS to create and serve fully dynamic HTML pages for any user in our users.js. Also the /users page.
- We created our own API endpoint which can be retreived by anyone using fetch and an accept: json header in /users/api, which returns a JSON list of all our users.
