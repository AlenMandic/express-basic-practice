# express-basic-practice
A very basic node/express server with simple full-stack capablities. For learning purposes.

This app can be used or cloned/forked by anyone if they want to play around with the code. Meant for NodeJS begginers. Instructions at the bottom.

In this app we:
- We set up a basic `Express.js` server in `server.js` as the base of our app
- Routing: We handle different routes and types of query params, from their own file. Including a large variety of `GET` requests, and we also allow the client to send in `POST` requests to our server from the front end, and we then send a response back!
- We create basic middleware functions including a simple error handler.
- We serve static files from our `/public/` folder using `express.static`
- I simulate simple data from a database in `/data/users.js`.
- We use a templating engine called `EJS` to create and serve fully dynamic HTML pages for any user in our `users.js`. Also the `/users` page.
- We create our own API endpoint which can be retreived by anyone using `fetch` and an `Accept: json` header in `/users/api`, which returns a JSON list of all our current users.

  In order to test the code out for yourself, you can clone the repository from GitHub or do it locally using git bash or command prompt.
   - Create a new empty folder for this project
   - Open git bash in that folders location and run:  `git clone https://github.com/AlenMandic/express-basic-practice`
   - while in the terminal install needed Node dependencies:
      - `npm install express`
      - `npm install ejs`
      - `npm install cors`
   - Then while you're in the root directory of the folder just run `npm start` or `node server.js` in the terminal to start the app.
